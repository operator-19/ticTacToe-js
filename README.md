# ticTacToe-js


This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with X or O. The first player to get three in a row wins the game. If no player gets three in a row and all spaces are filled, the game ends in a tie.

# Getting Started
To get started, simply click on the "Start" button. This will prompt you to enter the names of the two players. Once the names are entered, the game will start and the first player (Player 1) will be prompted to make a move. Click on any empty space to make a move. Once the move is made, it will be the other player's (Player 2) turn. Continue taking turns until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

To restart the game, simply click on the "Restart" button.

# Code Structure
The code is structured using the module pattern, with three modules:

displayController: This module handles rendering messages on the screen.

Gameboard: This module handles rendering and updating the gameboard.

Game: This module handles the game logic, including checking for wins and ties, handling player turns, and restarting the game.
